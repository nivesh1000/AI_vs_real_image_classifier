# Real vs AI-Generated Image Classification

This project focuses on distinguishing between real and AI-generated images using a deep learning model. The model is trained on images generated by StyleGAN, a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network (GAN), alongside real images.

## Features
- Binary classification of images as "Real" or "AI-Generated."
- Utilizes a DenseNet121-based architecture for feature extraction and classification.
- Includes data augmentation and preprocessing for robust model performance.
- Evaluates model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- **Real Images:** Photographs captured using conventional cameras.
- **AI-Generated Images:** Synthetic images produced by StyleGAN.

## Model Architecture
- Pretrained DenseNet121 as a feature extractor.
- Fully connected layers for binary classification.
- Dropout layers for regularization and avoiding overfitting.

## How It Works
1. **Preprocessing:** Images are resized to 224x224 and normalized.
2. **Training:** The model is trained using the preprocessed data with binary cross-entropy as the loss function.
3. **Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy and classification report are generated for performance analysis.
